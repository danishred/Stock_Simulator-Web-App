        <h1>Quota Limit Reached</h1>
        <p>"Hello there! I wanted to let you know that the stock data in this application is powered by Alpha Vantage's
            free-tier API, which has a daily request limit. It looks like the quota has been reached for today. The
            limit resets every 24 hours, so please check back later. Unless I purchase the paid API key, this is how
            the website is supposed to work. Apologies for the inconvenience, see you later ðŸ‘‹.</p>
